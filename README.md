# Digital_System_Design_Simulation-Cadence
 Designed and simulated a Digital Clock, 4 Floor Elevator Controller, Taxi Fare Meter, and Quiz Buzzer System. Built digital  circuits from scratch using MOSFETs in Cadence. 

 Designed and simulated various digital systems and circuits using Cadence tools, leveraging 90nm technology. Built all components and systems independently from scratch using MOSFET-based design. The library includes a wide range of gates, flip-flops, counters, and other digital components, which were used to implement several functional projects.
